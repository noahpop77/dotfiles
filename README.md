# My Configs
I really hate setting things up more than once so its time to do things properly and version control my config files.

# VIM Keybinds

### CTRL + p
Opens telescope for fuzzy file search

### CTRL + l
Opens fuzzy text searching across project

### CTRL + n
Toggles Neotree folder tree on the left of the screen

### gg=G
If in normal mode you type this it will reindent everything correctly. IT IS GOD TIER

# VIM Behavior

### Neo Tree
Due to Neotree some files in the tree will show up as an alt color (red, orange, whatever). This is because they were not pushed via git yet. It will track unpushed changes in files and show you what needs to be pushed in the tree itself which is cool
